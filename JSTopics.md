If there are some actions we have to execute after finishing another one we can make use of promises.
We can make use of callback as well to execute the function after finishing some other operations. But for asynchronous events it wont be suitable.

Promises in JavaScript give us the ability to write asynchronous code in a parallel manner to synchronous code.
It provide the JavaScript developer a tool for working with asynchronous events.

#### Closures

I would like to explain the following code snippet. 
```javascript
var add = function (a) {
    return function (b) {
        return a + b;
    };
};
```

addFive will contain reference to inner function. And when addFive is called then 10 is passed as an argument. but inner function will have access to variable a which will have the value 5. Therefore it will return the result as 15.

```javascript
var addFive = add(5);
alert(addFive(10));
```

#### How to add/register and listen for a custom event using javascript


Ref:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn741342(v=vs.94).aspx

In some cases we may have to add custom event and may need to listen for this event and can do some actions.

For example, check the below scenario.

Lets assume we have an iframe and we are getting the iframe src from an ajax call. In this case the iframe window height will only be set correctly after getting the url for the iframe and set to the src. So we can make use of custom event to trigger some actions after getting the actual height.

we can trigger a custom event after getting the iframe url as shown below.
```javascript
document.dispatchEvent(new Event("windowHeightReady"));
```

The above code will create an Event 'windowHeightReady' and will despatch the event and the corresponding listener can catch this.

Example:
```javascript
var sampleFunction = myFunction(){ 
console.log('My sample function to trigger on dispatching a custom event'); 
};

document.addEventListener('windowHeightReady', sampleFunction);
```

#### Scope

Scope is the set of variables you have access to. 
JavaScript has two scopes â€“ global and local. 
Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope, and is therefore accessible from anywhere in your code. 
Each function has its own scope, and any variable declared within that function is only accessible from that function and any nested functions.

#### call and apply

The difference is that apply lets you invoke the function with arguments as an array; call requires the parameters be listed explicitly.
Syntax:
```javascript
theFunction.apply(valueForThis, arrayOfArgs)

theFunction.call(valueForThis, arg1, arg2, ...)
```

#### css transitions

CSS transitions, provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.

Both throttling and debouncing will rate-limit execution of a function

#### promise and callback function.

The calling code can then wait until that promise is fulfilled before executing the next step. To do so, the promise has a method named then, which accepts a function that will be invoked when the promise has been fulfilled.

#### Inheritance in javascript

The JavaScript object oriented paradigm is prototype based. There are no "classes", just objects.

You can implement inheritance in different ways. The two more popular alternatives are the "pseudo-classical" and the "prototypal" forms.

#### file uploading using html

Sample:

HTML:
```html
 	<form action="/ajax-upload" id="ajax-attachment-upload-form">
            <input type="file" name="attachment" id="attachment" multiple accept=".xml"/>
            <input type="submit" value="Upload" />
        </form>
```

JS:
```javascript
	var files = [];

	$("input[type=file]").change(function(event) {
		$.each(event.target.files, function(index, file) {
			var reader = new FileReader();
			reader.onload = function(event) {
				object = {};
				object.filename = file.name;
				object.data = event.target.result;
				files.push(object);
			};
			reader.readAsDataURL(file);
		});
	});

	$("form").submit(function(form) {
		$.each(files, function(index, file) {
			$.ajax({url: "/ajax-upload",
				type: 'POST',
				data: {filename: file.filename, data: file.data},
				success: function(data, status, xhr) {}
			});
		});
		files = [];
		form.preventDefault();
	});
```

#### javascript hoisting

In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used. In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

#### how to use source map for debugging a minified/compressed script file?

When you build the application for production, along with minifying and combining your JavaScript files, 
you can generate a source map which holds information about your original files.

The minification and creating the source map file can be created using multiple tools like Closure compiler or Uglify

In the future we could easily use almost any language as though it were supported natively in the browser with source maps:

CoffeeScript
ECMAScript 6 and beyond
SASS/LESS and others
Pretty much any language that compiles to JavaScript.

Example:
If we are using the grunt build tool(with uglify) and if there is a task configured then add the following line:

```javascript
	grunt.initConfig({
		:
		:
		:
		uglify: {
			generated: {
				options: {
					sourceMap: true
				}
			}
		}
		:
		:
		:
		:
		});		
		
		grunt.registerTask('build', [
		:
		:
		'uglify',
		:
	]);
```
	
The above config will create the minification and concatenation using the 'Uglify' and create the source map file for the curresponding files.

Then in the browser if you observe the source map will be generated and the debugging can be done on the original file instead of the minified script file.	


#### SomeTricks for Debugging:
--------------------------

While debugging if you need to add some dynamic code and if you want to debug those scripts. Then also you can use this source mapping.

from the console:
Add some scripts and press enter:
```javascript
window.addEventListener('scroll', function(e){ 

console.log(document.body.scrollTop);

});
```

The above code will create a scroll event for the window and it will print the scrol position.
Lets assume if you want to debug this and to add some modification.

Add the below line in the console.
//# sourceURL=myDynamicScript.js

Then a new file will be added to the source section in the developer tool and we can easily debug this script.
This will help in adding and testing some UI functionality before deploying the code.
